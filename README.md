**The jsFiddle Chrome extension**

[*Taken from the Chrome store page*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hoeeafhdpifikmfdapokkjkcpijlbhne?hl=en-US)

If you are tired of navigating to jsFiddle, opening your dashboard and then opening your required fiddle, then this is going to make your day.

By simply clicking the jsFiddle icon you can view a list of your 100 latest fiddles with their latest revision and description, from there you can just select the one you want and begin editing.

To configure simply right click the icon and click options. When in the options page enter your jsFiddle username in the box and press enter. Now your fiddles will appear when ever you click the icon.
